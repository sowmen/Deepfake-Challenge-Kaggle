atxvxouljq.mp4_FAKE
Yolov2 with 20 pixel shorter give drastically better results. Bounded faces give better result for fake prediction. But also gives bad results for real prediction. 

Resize gives bad results. Resize with null padding is better. changed result from 0.003 to 0.37 in fake prediction. dlib is bad at multiface detection from sides.
